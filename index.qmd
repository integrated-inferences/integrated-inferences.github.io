*Integrated Inferences* provides an introduction to fundamental principles of causal inference and Bayesian updating and shows how these tools can be used to implement and justify inferences using within-case (process tracing) evidence, correlational patterns across many cases, or a mix of the two. 

You can buy the  book at [Cambridge University Press](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/integrated-inferences/45B07964AD4718A74CDE3E35A31F26FA), read the  [open access preprint](https://macartan.github.io/integrated_inferences/), explore the `R` package [`CausalQueries`](https://integrated-inferences.github.io/CausalQueries/), and read a 
[guide](https://macartan.github.io/assets/pdf/papers/2025_CausalQueries.pdf) to forming, updating, and querying causal models with  `CausalQueries` (Tietz et al, provisionally accepted *JSS*)
